                <h1>Learn Web Development In The Easiest Way</h1>
                <p>Firstly , I would like to tell you that web development is not all covered in CS classes , as the CS
                    syllabus only contains just the basic of HTML , CSS and JavaScript. So , even if you intend to take
                    your CS classes you would be learning just the theory and thats’ not web development at all .

                    Web development rather invloves building of websites in a way that developers can -
                    Program a browser (like using JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, or Vue)
                    Program a server (like using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node)
                    Program a database (like using SQL, SQLite, or MongoDB)
                    Now ,
                    <br><br>
                    Coming to the question of how can one start to learn web development from scratch . Here I am
                    suggesting some resources that you can refer :
                    You can follow some good YouTube Channels like CodeWithHarry , ThapaTechnical , ApnaCollege,and Net
                    Ninja.
                    You can refer w3schools and practice out things as per that , as there all topics are explained and
                    then thier applications are shown practically.
                    You can refer some documentations of tutorialspont and geeksfogeeks as every concept is exaplained
                    in simple language here.
                    You can use Codepen , i.e, an online IDE. You can practice coding in different languages and save
                    your work online. You will enjoy this as you are practising and learning at the same time.
                    You can enroll for a course at Freecodecamp which web dev courses right from beginner to an advanced
                    level. But from personal opinion it should be opted after having a base level knowledge of web
                    development.
                    Talking about my experience , I decided to start learning web development in the lockdown in my
                    second year. So I did some research on how to get started . I refered to the above resources but was
                    not able to apply my knowledge for developing projects.Also , some of my doubts remained unresolved
                    .
                    Then , I tried a free trial of Full Stack Web development with NodeJS course from Coding Ninjas
                    platform and found it really awesome as the course followed a well structured approach that helped
                    me to retain all the concepts properly.Later I decided to purchase and continue with the course .
                    You can ping me in case of any queries.
                    <br><br>
                    Let’s start learning Web…
                    <br><br>

                        allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        <br><br>
                    Stages to follow:
                    <br><br>
                    Stage 1 –<span>HTML:</span>
                    <br>
                    HTML, you have heard about it lots of times before.
                    If I am not wrong HTML is the language you have learned in your school life.
                    Yes, it’s actually the same as what you have learned a long time ago but as long as time changes
                    technologies are changing. Nowadays as you have grown up, even HTML has grown up too, now there is
                    called HTML5 comes into existence. What? Worried about what is it? Don’t be. I just said that as we
                    have grown up HTML has grown up too but the difference between us and HTML is, it changed its name
                    to HTML5. In HTML5, you can not just prepare the basic structure of the web page but we have many
                    more things that we can do. We can store and process values on variables on-page itself without any
                    databases as we do in any programming language (Temporary variables), we can develop games on it. No
                    need for the flash to play animations on it. Even we can develop a fully functional blog with HTML4
                    itself without any help to server-side scripting languages.&
                    <br><br>
                    Stage 2 – <span>CSS:</span>
                    <br>
                    We live in such a society where everybody wants to look pretty, and beautiful, and to achieve this
                    everyone does makeup. Similarly, CSS does for HTML. CSS creates beauty on HTML pages. With the help
                    of CSS, you can make your web page colorful and smooth. You can even create animations using CSS.
                    You can add transitions, change the scrolling events of your pages, mouse-click events, and many
                    more. But as HTML changes to HTML5, CSS also has been changed to CSS3.
                    <br><br>
                    Stage 3 – <span>JAVASCRIPT:</span>
                    <br>
                    You have learned how your site will look like, you have designed the beauty of your page yet. Now,
                    it turns to creating some useful tasks that your web page elements will do when some activities are
                    performed on your web pages like button click events, mouse over any text, playing and pausing some
                    animations on the page, etc. With the help of JAVASCRIPT, you can do that easily. One of the best
                    scripting languages used to make a web page more smooth, flexible and platform-independent is
                    javascript. It’s not that easy to learn but whatever you learned at an easy level, will be enough to
                    do your all tasks.
                    <br><br>
                    Stage 4 – <span>BOOTSTRAP:</span>
                    <br>
                    Remember the term Responsive? Okay, let me explain to you what exactly a responsive website means.
                    Responsive websites are those sites that change their element’s alignments, and spacing according to
                    the screen size of the device it is browsing. This is the technology called Bootstrap which makes it
                    easier to design a responsive website. Bootstrap is an open-source front-end framework that works
                    with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design responsive websites for your laptops, tablets, and mobile
                    devices.
                    <br><br>
                    Stage 5 – <span>PHP:</span>
                    <br>
                    As of now you have learned about how your web page will look like, how the interface of your web
                    page users will face. How it reacts based upon the user’s activity but only at the client machine.
                    But nowadays we have the works of a lot perform on the back end of our web page called server. So to
                    code on the server side we need server-side scripting language which one is PHP (Hypertext
                    Preprocessor). We have also many other server-side scripting languages are there like Asp.net, JSP
                    etc but PHP is one of the easiest and most used server-side scripting languages.
                    <br>
                    How to Run a PHP program on your local machine? As PHP is a server-side scripting language it must
                    have a server to run. So how can you do that? Surely you can not afford a server to learn PHP. So
                    don’t worry about it. We have a lot of tools available in the IT market which helps you to run PHP
                    codes on your local machine. The following tools can be used to run PHP codes on local machine:
                    <br>
                    WAMP(Windows, Apache MySQL, PHP) – For windows machines
                    LAMP(Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) – For Linux based machines
                    XAMP(X-for any OS, Apache, My-Sql, PHP) – It can work on any OS
                    <br>
                    Now it comes to databases, We have so many data available to display on the web page but we just
                    can’t simply store them on web pages. A database management system is important because it manages
                    data efficiently and allows users to perform multiple tasks with ease. A database management system
                    stores organize and manages a large amount of information within a single software application.
                    MY-SQL is one of the open-source database management available in the IT industry. I am recommending
                    learning PHP language instead of ASP and JSP just because it provides easiest way to connect MY-SQL
                    database with it If you have a basic concept of C/C++ Programming languages. Even you can practice
                    the connectivity of PHP and MY-SQL on your local machine with the help of tools discussed above.
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Advance Technologies to Learn:</span>
                    <br>
                    Why should you learn advanced technologies? Obviously, this question will be arising in your mind.
                    It’s absolutely true that you can develop a fully functional website with a well designed front end
                    and a good performance back end but what if you want to design such a website like Amazon, Flipkart,
                    Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Snapdeal, OLX, etc. Those websites are not just using the above
                    languages, tools but they use more than these technologies that I am going to explain to you as
                    below.
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Frameworks:</span>
                    <br> Frameworks are built to make building and working with programming languages easier. Frameworks
                    typically take all the difficult, repetitive tasks in setting up a new web application and either
                    does them for you or make them very easy for you to do
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Django </span>– A full-stack framework built using python.
                    <br>
                    Ruby On Rails – A full-stack framework built using ruby.<br>
                    <span>Node.js</span> – is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment built on Chrome’s V8
                    JavaScript
                    engine for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser.
                    PhoneGap or Cordova – A mobile framework that exposes native api’s of iOS and Android for use when
                    writing javascript.
                    <br>
                    WordPress – A CMS (content management system) built on PHP. Currently, about 20% of all websites run
                    on this framework
                    <br>
                    < Drupal – A CMS framework built using PHP. <br>
                        <span>AngularJS</span> – A front-end javascript framework<br><br>
                        Libraries: Libraries are groupings of code snippets to enable a large amount of functionality
                        without having to write it all by yourself. Libraries typically also go through the trouble to
                        make sure the code is efficient and works well across browsers and devices (not always the case,
                        but typically they do).
                        <br><br>
                        <span>Jquery</span> –
                        <br>Its a javascript library which makes HTML documents traversal, manipulations, event
                        handling, animations and AJAX with a much easy to use API that works with multiple browsers.
                        UnderScore.js – Its also a javascript library that provides a whole mess of functional
                        programming helpers.
                        <br><br>
                        <span>API</span>: An API is an application programming interface. It is created by the developer
                        of an
                        application to allow other developers to use some of the application’s functionality without
                        sharing code. Developers expose “endpoints” which are like inputs and outputs of the
                        application. Using an API can control access with API keys. Examples of good APIs are those
                        created by Facebook, Twitter, and Google for their web services.
                        <br>
                        So, friends! stop thinking and start doing….
